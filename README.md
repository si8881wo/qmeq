QmeQ: Quantum master equation for Quantum dot transport calculations
====================================================================

**NOTE: This is an extended version of QmeQ to perform noise calculations via counting statistics** 

Changes to the base QmeQ include the ability to calculate the second current
cumulant via counting statistic for the first order approaches and the RTD approach.
Note, that the changes in the first order approaches are directly in the approaches
(subject to change), while in the RTD case RTDnoise was added as a separate approach.

====================================================================

QmeQ is an open-source Python package for calculations of transport through
quantum  dot devices. The so-called Anderson-type models are used to describe
the quantum dot device, where quantum dots are coupled to the leads by
tunneling. QmeQ can calculate the stationary state **particle** and
**energy currents** using various approximate density matrix approaches. As for
now we have implemented the following first-order methods

* Pauli (classical) master equation
* Lindblad approach
* Redfield approach
* First order von Neumann (1vN) approach

which can describe the effect of Coulomb blockade. Additionally, there is a
possibility to model electron-phonon interaction inside a quantum dot using
the first-order approaches. QmeQ also has two second-order methods

* Second order von Neumann (2vN) approach
* Real Time Diagrammatic (RTD) approach

2vN and RTD approaches can address the effects of cotunneling and pair tunneling.
Additionally, the 2vN approach can describe broadening of quantum dot states.
The advantage of RTD approach is that it requires a lot less memory and
computation time resources.

Physics disclaimer
------------------

All the methods in QmeQ are approximate so depending on parameter regime they
**can fail**, and a good knowledge of the method is required whether to trust
the result or not. For example, Redfield, 1vN, and 2vN approaches can **violate
positivity** of the reduced density matrix and lead to **currents flowing against
the bias**. We still think it is important to have a package where a user can
duplicate existing calculations, check applicability of different methods, or
simply discover new kind of physics using different approximate master equations.
